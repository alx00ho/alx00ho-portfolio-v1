                <p>Growing up, I enjoyed working with puzzles and building structures using K'nex building sets. I would
                    spend hours working patiently and cautiously placing the pieces together. Puzzles are still one of my
                    favorites pastimes, listening to albums and soundtracks while at work. Once I learned about coding
                    in high school, I thought that Computer Science would be an exciting fit for my major and aligned with
                    my career interests thus achieved a Bachelor of Science C.S. degree from the University of North
                    Carolina. During my time as an undergraduate student, I did run into a couple of laptop issues, battery
                    and RAM failures, that caused me to learn new development sequences to conitnue to be active in group
                    projects and finishing class assignments on time. One of my favorite projects that was a Rocket League Stats
                    webpage that took the replays of professional Rocket League and complied them into a spreadsheet-like table
                    for users to nitpick and critique their favorite players and teams.
