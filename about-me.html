          Growing up, I have always been captivated by creating projects with my
          hands. Puzzles, K'nex building sets, and the like caught my attention.
          I would spend hours working patiently with a detailed eye to placing
          the pieces together. Puzzles are still one of my favorite pastimes,
          where I can listen to enticing albums and podcasts while at work.
        </p>

          I discovered the Software Developer career path in high school, which
          fascinated both the logical and creative parts of my brain and thus
          pursued and achieved a Bachelor of Science C.S. degree from the
          University of North Carolina in 2022. During my undergraduate career,
          I learned that time is very precious and to use it wisely between my
          peers, family, friends, and myself. Quickly learning my development
          skills made me an active contributor to group projects and finish
          class assignments on time.

          One of my favorite projects is a Rocket League Statistics web
          application that leveraged the ballchasing API to compile data from
          both professional and collegiate Rocket League matches into a dynamic,
          searchable table for users to search for their favorite players and
          teams and compare various statistics. We added user authentication and
          the option for them to favorite players and teams and pool them into a
          personalized list. Players and teams also had pop-up info cards that
          held their nationality and team history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another project that I enjoyed was a web application for Promised Land
          Journey, a game developed by Ancient Path Adventures (APA). We
          developed a platform where APA could create modules stored in a
          database. These modules consisted of quizzes, videos, and readings.
          Teachers were allowed to use these example modules or make their own
          after paying a subscription to use APA's services. Upon class
          creation, teachers could give out their unique, randomly generated
          access code for students to join their classes and take the modules.

          Outside of my technical skills, I enjoy dabbling in other creative
          avenues. Being a former percussionist, I try to maintain and grow my
          playing skills by performing with the nearby church or some rudimental
          drumming. I've also been developing my listening and composition
          skills on the side. Cooking helps me connect with my Vietnamese
          heritage and is something I want to share with my friends and future
          family. The newest of my hobbies is 3D rendering, where I've followed
          the Blender Guru's tutorial on a donut animation and plan on bringing
          places I've been into the digital world.
