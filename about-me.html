          Growing up, I have always been captivated with creating projects with
          my hands. Puzzles, K'nex building sets, and the like caught my
          attention. I would spend hours working patiently and with a detailed
          eye place the pieces together. Puzzles are still one of my favorites
          pastimes, where I'm able to listen to enticing albums and podcasts
          while at work.
        </p>

          I discovered the Software Developer career path in high school where
          it fascinated the creative part of my brain and thus pursued and
          achieved a Bachelor of Science C.S. degree from the University of
          North Carolina in 2022. During my undergraduate career, I learned that
          time is very precious and to use it wisely between my peers, family,
          friends, and myself. When building my development skills, I had to
          learn them quickly to be active in my contributions on group projects
          and finishing class assignments on time.
        </p>

          One of my favorite projects is a Rocket League Statistics web
          application which complied data from professional and collegiate
          Rocket League matches using the ballchasing API and complied them into
          a readable table for users to search their favorite players and teams
          and compare various statistics. We were able to authenticate users and
          allow them to favorite players and teams and pool them into a list.
          Player and teams also had pop-up info cards that held their
          nationality and team history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another project that I thoroughly enjoyed was Ancient Path Adventures
          (APA) where my team and I created a web application for their game,
          Promised Land Journey. We developed a platform where APA were able to
          create their own modules directly related to the game and stored them
          in a database. These modules consisted of quizzes, videos, and
          readings. Teachers were allowed to use these example modules or make
          their own after paying a subscription to use APA's services. Students
          could join classes thorugh a unique access code that was randomly
          generated upon class created.
        </p>

          Outside of my technical skills, I enjoy dabbling in other creative
          aspects. Being a former percussionist, I try to maintain and grow my
          playing skills by performing with the nearby church or some rudimental
          drumming. I've also been trying to develop my ear and do some
          composition on the side. Cooking helps me connect with my Vietnamese
          heritage and is something that I want to share with my friends and
          future family. The newest of the them is 3D rendering, where I've
          followed the Blender Guru's tutorial on a donut animation and I plan
          on bringing places I've been into the digital world.
