          Growing up, I enjoyed working with puzzles and building structures
          using K'nex building sets. I would spend hours working patiently and
          cautiously placing the pieces together. Puzzles are still one of my
          favorites pastimes, where I'm able to listen to enticing albums and
          podcasts while at work. Once I learned about coding in high school, I
          thought that Computer Science would be an exciting fit for my major
          and aligned with my career interests thus achieved a Bachelor of
          Science C.S. degree from the University of North Carolina. During my
          time as an undergraduate student, I ran into a couple of laptop
          issues, battery and RAM failures, that forced me to learn new
          development sequences quickly to conitnue to be active in group
          projects and finishing class assignments on time. One of my favorite
          projects that was a Rocket League Stats webpage that took the replays
          of professional Rocket League and complied them into a
          spreadsheet-like table for users to nitpick and critique their
          favorite players and teams. Another project that I thoroughly enjoyed
          was Ancient Path Adventures where my team and I created a web
          application for their game, allowing teachers to create and assign
          modules that students would be able to join and interact with.
